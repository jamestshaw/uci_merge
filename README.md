# uci_merge
This repository was created to satisfy the final requirement for the Coursera class titled 'Getting and Cleaning Data'.  It contains the following:
  1. The original unaltered data in a directory called 'UCI HAR Dataset'.
  2. A codebook called 'CodeBook.md' which describes the data, its variables, and the transformations I performed on that     data.  
  3. Two tidy data sets as text files: 'uci_by_trial.txt' and 'uci_by_variable.txt', which are the result of the transformations performed.
  4. An R script called 'run_analysis.R' which reads in the UCI directory and generates the transformed data files.
